Disaster Data Handling Using KaaS

In this project, Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) approach is used for crime data management. 
It has two main components: 

1) Predictive analysis based on the data collected 
2) Crowd sourcing which collects real time data from public using tweets. 

A web application designed to enable the reception of timely notifications of catastrophic events based on the 
geo-location capabilities of the device.
